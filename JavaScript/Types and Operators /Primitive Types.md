# Primitive Types

There are 7 primitive types:

`undefined`

- Represents a value that is not defined or has not been assigned.
- Don't set a variable to `undefined` on purpose. Variables get `undefined` when you don't give them a value when declaring them (assigned by the compiler).

`null`

- Null means there's nothing in a variable. It's like saying, 'This doesn't have any value or thing inside it.
- Unlike `undefined`, `null` is used when you want to show that a variable or object property has no value.

`boolean`

- Represents a binary value: `true` or `false`.

`number`

- Represents a floating-point number.

`string`

- Represents a sequence of characters.

`symbol`

`bigint`
