# Operators

- Operators are like special functions for working with values, variables, or expressions.
- The primary difference between operators and regular functions is the syntax for invoking them.
- Here's an example to make it easier to understand:

```jsx
// When adding two numbers using a function-like syntax
var z = +(x, y);

// Alternatively, to enhance the development experience, the plus operator is used, more like a real-life addition
var a = b + c;
```
