# Coercion

Type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another.

```jsx
var a = 1 + '2'; //Output: 12
```

Coercion occurs because JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means we don't need to explicitly set the types of variables or values. Instead, the compiler does its best to understand what we're trying to do, often resulting in **implicit type** conversions to make operations work.

❓ **Implicit type** means that the type is automatically declared for a variable.
