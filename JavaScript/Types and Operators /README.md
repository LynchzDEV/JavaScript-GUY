- **Dynamic Typing**: Learn how variables can change their type at runtime.
- **[Primitive Types](./Primitive%20Types.md)**: Understand the basic data types in JavaScript like Number, String, Boolean, etc.
- **[Operators](./Operators.md)**: Get to know how to manipulate data using different operators.
- **[Coercion](./Coercion.md)**: Dive into the implicit type conversion that happens in JavaScript.

Feel free to navigate through the sections to build your foundation in JavaScript types and operators.
