# Functions in JavaScript

This section is all about functions in JavaScript, which are the workhorses of the language. We will cover a range of topics to give you a comprehensive understanding of how functions work. Topics include:

- **[Higher-Order Functions](./Higher-Order%20Functions)**: Understand how functions can accept other functions as arguments and return functions as results.
- **[Arrow Functions](./Arrow%20Functions.md)**: Learn about the shorthand syntax for writing functions and how it differs from regular function expressions.
- **[Named vs Anonymous Functions](./Named%20vs%20Anonymous%20Functions.md)**: Explore the pros and cons of giving a function a name versus leaving it anonymous.
- **[Nested Functions](./Nested%20Functions.md)**: Discover how functions can be defined within other functions and what this means for scoping.
- **[Closure Functions](./Closure%20Functions.md)**: Dive into closures, a powerful JavaScript feature that allows a function to remember its outer scope even after the outer function has finished execution.

Feel free to browse through these topics to solidify your understanding of JavaScript functions.
