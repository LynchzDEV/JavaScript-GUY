[Why JavaScript is a Prototype-based OOP](https://github.com/LynchzDEV/JavaScript-GUY/blob/main/JavaScript/Objects/Prototype%20vs%20Class%20OOP/preview2.png)

In a class-based OOP, we use classes as a blueprint for creating the objects, whereas in a prototype-based OOP, we can create the objects without first defining their class.

So, if we donâ€™t need a class, how do we inherit properties? Instead, objects inherit from other objects through a prototype property.

### **Prototypes and proto-Properties**

Prototypes play a central role in JavaScript's prototype-based OOP. Each object has a hidden property called **`prototype`**, represented by **`[[Prototype]]`**, which points to another object. This object, referred to as "the prototype of that object," holds the properties and methods that the object inherits.

This approach allows us to create objects with similar functionality to those in class-based OOPs.

## **How prototype works**

```jsx
const person = {
  name: 'Park',
  age: 18,
};

console.log(person.name); // Park
```

We are accessing the existing properties from the given code, **but what if that property doesnâ€™t exist?**

If the property we are looking for doesnâ€™t exist in the property, the JS engine will try to search `[[prototype]]`, **this process is known as prototype chaining.**

### Letâ€™s take a look at a quick example:

```jsx
const car = {
  wheelsAmount: 4,
};

const fordMustang = {
  color: 'black',
  brand: 'ford',
};
Object.setPrototypeOf(fordMustang, car);

console.log(fordMustang.wheelsAmount); // 4
```

In this example, the `fordMustang` object inherits from the `car` object using the `Object.setPrototypeOf(object, prototype)` method. When attempting to access the `wheelsAmount` property in the `fordMustang` object, which doesn't exist, the JS Engine looks at `[[prototype]]` and searches the `car` object.
